# Sinclar ZX81 
Model: Issue One / 2C184E ULA / Dual RAM ICs

I purchased this ZX81 in a lot together with several other computers, RAM expansions, printers and casettes.

# Inspection and initial troubleshooting:

This ZX81 was showing a completely blank screen on power up and after some troubleshooting I found the ULA to be faulty.
