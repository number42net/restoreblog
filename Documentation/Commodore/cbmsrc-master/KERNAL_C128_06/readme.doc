   C128 ROM RELEASE NOTES:		318020-06, 318023-03	      05/30/88


   THE FOLLOWING MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE 318020-05 KERNEL  CODE TO
   CREATE A NEW ROM SET RELEASED ON 05/30/88.  THIS  RELEASE IS FOR USE IN THE
   FOLLOWING SYSTEMS:  C128, C128D, C128CR, C128DCR.  ROMS WILL BE BUILT FOR
   ONLY THE CURRENT 32K BYTE "CR" SYSTEMS, HOWEVER (318023-03).

   1.  # 318023-03 --> EDITOR, KERNEL, CP/M ($C000-$FFFF, U32) cksum= E424
   2.  # 318020-06 --> EDITOR, KERNEL, CP/M ($C000-$FFFF)      cksum= DFC4

	1.  SECURE.  This kernel initialization routine has been modified
	    to accomodate technological advances in DRAMs.  The discharge
	    rates for data cells has lengthened considerably and it is no
	    longer possible to rely upon the  loss  of data as indicative
	    of a  power cycle as opposed to a  reset.  The SECURE routine
	    has been  patched  to  examine  the contents of the  8568 VDC
	    registers  which  will  contain  $FF if power cycled but will
	    retain their previously  programmed data through resets.  The
	    existing detection of a "CBM" RAM key in bank one remains for
	    compatability.  This patch required new code in patch area.

	2.  DLABYE.  This kernel  serial  I/O routine has been patched to
	    provide a longer delay.  This will eliminate certain randomly
	    occurring DEVICE NOT READY errors, particularly at 2MHz. This
	    was accomplished via single byte inline patch.

	3.  OPN232.  This kernel  routine  has  been patched to correctly
	    return error status.  When  implementing  an X-line interface
	    it was possible to receive an error when there was none. This
	    was accomplished via single byte inline patch.

	4.  The ROM  signature at location $CFFC  and  $CFFD  (lo/hi)  is
	    $8C3E.

	5.  The ROM revision byte at location $CFFE, has incremented from
	    $01 to $02.

	6.  The ROM checksum byte at  location  $CFFF,  has  changed from
	    $3C to $3B.

	7.  The Kernel revision byte at location  $FF80  has  incremented
	    from $01 to $02.
