# Macintosh Color Classic
This computer belongs to a customer, the request was to check the machine and perform any repairs necessary. Because of the type of the capacitors used there's quite a few that need to be replaced on the logic and analogue boards.

#### Work done so far
+ Inspect boards
+ Test machine
+ Service floppy drive

#### Planned work
+ Replace electrolytic capacitors on the logic board
+ Replace capacitors on the analogue board

# Initial inspection
Here are some pictures of the computer while opening it up:

Most likely the front of the case was exposed to some kind of liquid, I found this white dirt in several places close by:

This also likely caused some of this corrosion:

I cleaned up the worst on the analogue board RF shield:

Finally here is a shot of the computer booted up:

# Floppy drive 

The floppy drive was fairly clean, but the grease was fully dry. I disassembled the drive to fully clean and lubricate it:
