# Sinclair QL 
I purchased this Sinclair QL locally as unknown / untested, together with the power supply and 8 Microdrive cartridges. When I opened it up, I found an issue 7 board. Judging from the date codes on the ICs it was probably manufactured late 1984 or early 1985.

Overall, the computer is great condition, the only fault I was able to identify so far is the keyboard membrane, which is a common issue for all computers with these types of keyboards. 

# Initial inspection:

Here are some pictures of the machine after collecting it:

After verifying the voltages from the power supply were correct and having a quick look inside, I decided to power it up. Success on the first boot:

But straight away I noticed an issue, the keyboard was not responding. After checking the keyboard membrane, it was badly cracked around the connector. I attempted to cut off the worst section and reconnect the remaining part, but new cracks appeared straight away.

This project is on hold until the replacement membrane arrives, and I can continue testing.
