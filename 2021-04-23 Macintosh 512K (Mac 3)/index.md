# Macintosh 512K
This computer belongs to a customer, the request was to check the overall machine and specifically low brightness / contrast and service the floppy drive.

#### Work done so far
+ Inspect boards
+ Test machine
+ Test capacitors

#### Planned work
+ Replace bad capacitors
+ Service floppy drive

# Capacitors:

Aside from 2 Rifa capacitors the blue axial capacitor tested bad, it looks out of place and was probably replaced at some point. All other capacitors tested good.

# Low brightness

When I first powered on the computer the brightness was very low and the knob on the front couldn't adjust it high enough. I checked a few common resistors but all tested correct.

The bad capacitor I found has a very high ESR which could cause this problem as well, I will investigate further after replacing it. In the meantime I've adjusted the cut-off voltage to improve the display.

# Floppy drive

The floppy drive was a bit dirty and all the lubricant had dried up:

The ejection mechanism was still in good shape:

All cleaned up and ready to go back together:
