There was already quite a mess from the leaking electrolytic capacitors:

# Main board
After removing the old capacitors I gave the board a thorough cleaning:

A few suspect traces were found, these will be cleaned, tinned and protected with new solder mask.

# Power supply
Once the motherboard was done, it was time to move on to the power supply.

Overall it was cleaner than I had expected, but the fan was pretty crusty:

After cleaning, I found it spun freely, so no need to replace it:
