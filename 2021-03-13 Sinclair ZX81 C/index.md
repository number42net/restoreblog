# Sinclar ZX81 
Model: Issue One / 2C184E ULA / Dual RAM ICs

I purchased this ZX81 in a lot together with several other computers, RAM expansions, printers and casettes.

# Inspection and initial troubleshooting:

The keyboard membrane is showing some cracks

My TV was not able to sync with the image generated by the computer, this is caused by an early 2C184E ULA, which is known to generate a video signal which is not compatible with most newer TVs.
