# Macintosh II Classic

I purchased this Macintosh in a lot together with a Macintosh SE. It was sold as faulty / spares. After removing the logic board, I found that the electrolytic capacitors had leaked all over the logic board, damaging several components.

## Work done so far: 

* Partial inspection and testing

## Planned work: 

* Recap and repair work
* Deep cleaning inside and out
* Hard disk replacement
* Floppy drive cleaning and libration
* Colour restoration of the plastic
* Re-installation
* Fully reversible external battery modification

## Exterior inspection:

Resistor R39 is damaged, most likely capacitor C49 as well:

On the other side of the board R17 and possibly R18 were also burned out.

Schematics show all of these are related to the EGRET IC:

Upon inspection the egret pins are clearly damaged from electrolyte leaking capacitors, as well many other chips.
